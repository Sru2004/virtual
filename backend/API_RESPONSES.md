## Frontend Error Handling

### Recommended Implementation

```javascript
try {
  const response = await api.uploadArtwork(formData);
  
  if (response.success) {
    // Show success message
    showSuccessMessage(response.message);
    // Update UI with new artwork
    addArtworkToList(response.artwork);
  }
  
} catch (error) {
  // Parse error response
  const errorMessage = error.message || 'Upload failed';
  
  if (errorMessage.includes('already been uploaded')) {
    // Exact duplicate
    showDuplicateError(
      'This exact image already exists in the gallery.',
      'Please choose a different image to upload.'
    );
    
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('similar image')) {
    // Similar image
    showSimilarImageError(
      'A very similar image was found.',
      'Please upload a more unique artwork.'
    );
    
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Missing required fields')) {
    // Validation error
    showValidationError('Please fill in all required fields.');
    
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('Only artists')) {
    // Authorization error
    showAuthError('You need to be registered as an artist to upload.');

## Testing Examples

### cURL - Upload Artwork
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "title=Test Artwork" \
  -F "description=Test description" \
  -F "category=digital" \
  -F "price=1000"
```

### cURL - Test Duplicate (Should Fail)
```bash
# Upload same image again
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@path/to/same-image.jpg" \
  -F "title=Different Title" \
  -F "category=digital" \
  -F "price=2000"

# Expected: 409 Conflict with duplicate message
```

### Postman Collection

```json
{
  "name": "Upload Artwork",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "{{baseUrl}}/api/artworks/upload",
    "header": [
      {
        "key": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer {{token}}"
      }
    ],
    "body": {
      "mode": "formdata",
      "formdata": [
        {
          "key": "image",
          "type": "file",
          "src": "path/to/image.jpg"
        },
        {
          "key": "title",
          "value": "Test Artwork"
        },
        {
          "key": "category",
          "value": "digital"

## Monitoring & Logging

### What Gets Logged

```javascript
// Upload request received
console.log('Upload request received');
console.log('User:', req.user);
console.log('Body:', req.body);
console.log('File:', req.file);

// Hash generation
console.log('Starting duplicate detection...');
console.log('Generated SHA-256 hash:', imageHash);
console.log('Generated perceptual hash:', perceptualHash);

// Duplicate detection
console.log('Exact duplicate detected:', exactDuplicate._id);
console.log('Similar image detected:', artwork._id);
console.log('No duplicates found, proceeding with upload...');

// Success
console.log('Artwork saved successfully');

// Errors
console.error('Upload error:', error);
console.error('Error deleting file:', err);
```

### Useful Metrics to Track

1. **Duplicate Detection Rate**
   - Exact duplicates caught
   - Similar images caught
   - False positives (similar but should allow)

2. **Performance**
   - Hash generation time
   - Database query time
   - Total upload time

3. **Storage Saved**
   - Number of duplicate uploads prevented
   - Estimated storage saved (MB/GB)
